# Java Project: Shop Management System 🏪

The **Shop Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage the operations of a retail shop.  
Throughout multiple practices, the project evolves from **file-based persistence** to **relational databases (JDBC & Hibernate)** and finally to **NoSQL persistence using MongoDB**, applying clean architecture principles and design patterns.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a **scalable, maintainable, and technology-agnostic shop management system** capable of handling:

- Product and inventory management  
- Inventory import and export  
- Persistent storage using different technologies  
- Employee authentication  

Each iteration introduces a new data access strategy while preserving the same business logic through the **DAO pattern**.
